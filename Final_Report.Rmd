## Research Question

Our research question aims to ask which categories appear most often in the 35 seasons that Jeopardy has run. In this analysis, we will look at the top 5 most repeated categories and themes of the numerous categories that were only used once. To look at category themes, we will use a word search to group category types and isolate commonalities. Lastly, we will use a word search to identify current events and link the event to the season inwhich that category was used.
